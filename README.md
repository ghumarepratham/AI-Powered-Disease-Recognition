# AI-Powered-Disease-Recognition

Overview The AI-Powered Disease Recognition project leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to identify diseases from medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, or skin images. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing accurate, fast, and automated diagnosis to support decision-making and improve patient outcomes.


-  AI-Powered Disease Recognition helps doctors diagnose diseases from medical images like X-rays and MRIs
-  Used OpenCV and Python to improve the quality of the images by reducing noise and adjusting the contrast
- I used TensorFlow and machine learning to train models for fast and accurate disease identification.
- The system reduces human mistakes, helps doctors make faster decisions, and leads to better patient care.


## Technologies:

- Streamlit (for building the web app)
- Jupyter Notebooks (if using .ipynb files)
- Python (programming language)
- Cohere API (for chatbot integration)
- Pillow (image processing)
- Tesseract OCR (optical character recognition)
- OpenCV (image preprocessing and manipulation)


## Libraries:
- pandas (for data manipulation and storage)

- numpy (for numerical operations)

- cv2 (OpenCV) (for computer vision tasks)

- re (for regular expressions)
